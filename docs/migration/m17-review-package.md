# M-17 review package: isolated parallel production canary

## Status

The M-17 parallel-canary material is retained as historical handoff evidence.
As of August 21, 2026, the standalone permanent Chalkwright lane is deployed
from protected GitHub `main`, serves the existing classroom URL and display
mount, and runs its permanent refresh, glossary, Calendar, integrity, backup,
and deployment timers. Google Calendar follows the local canonical plan. The
historical shadow service remains active only as an available rollback
reference and is not the current serving path. Remaining M-17 work is
stabilization evidence and an explicit transition to M-18 retirement; the
detailed canary chronology below remains historical and is not rewritten.

The final canary parity delta closed the derived-plan/persistence contract
split that produced the last sanitized future-plan failure class: a period too
short to contain the configured dismissal window is rejected during canonical
acquisition, before any plan-store call, and the bounded future lookup may
continue to a later valid class day. It also composes copied and strictly
validated static lesson cards and meeting-scoped vocabulary from
Chalkwright-owned SQLite with fresh Classroom objectives. The presentation now
has bilingual English/Vietnamese vocabulary faces, a dedicated bellringer
treatment, staged details, carousel enter/leave motion, reduced-motion static
vocabulary, and bounded content compaction. An optional HTTPS-only course
mapping supplies the independent attendance QR destination. Those changes were
offline at that checkpoint; subsequent permanent-production qualification and
classroom use supersede that pending-live statement.

Native repair is the sole PowerSchool recovery path. The executable
OpenClaw state bridge, its test, and its repository-safety exception have been
removed; historical evidence remains in ADR-0024 and this package.
At that historical checkpoint, the host's inactive installation was release
`sha256:a0354f63bcae4903d1b076eba1cb5fbbb152f0cd09203df617551a3fad4735b3`;
it is the exact predecessor and rollback target for the next serialized inert
upgrade. No candidate unit or provider timer is active and the candidate route
is absent at this handoff. The repair unit is immutable across this upgrade,
and all seventeen candidate units remain inactive while their exact templates
are backed up and transactionally replaced; any repair-unit drift fails closed.
Restoration is armed before the first replacement, and the verified code/unit
pair is committed before temporary rollback material is removed. Injected
mid-copy and post-switch cleanup failures prove that the installed units and
selected release cannot diverge. Cleanup derives the selected digest from the
actual `current` symlink, and a post-move/pre-next-instruction regression proves
that interruption at the atomic switch boundary cannot leave a dangling
selection. An injected rollback failure also proves the safe ambiguous outcome:
the new release and matching new units are retained together for explicit
recovery rather than partially restoring the predecessor.

The subsequently authorized first live-preflight stage completed on 2026-08-12:

- protected provisioning created eight isolated canary files and reported zero
  provider requests, unit starts, or route changes;
- the independently audited release
  `sha256:8dd31c682f71af124ca20ef5836d47328fb1baddc7d17089a9bebc2fba0cff3a`
  installed sixteen inert units and started none; and
- the privilege-dropped, release-bound state copier retained eleven validated
  PowerSchool cookies, zero origin storage, zero browser profiles, zero Google
  origins, and made zero provider requests.

No browser or sign-in was used in that first stage. Activation, routing, and
Fully Kiosk changes remained separately gated.

The later objective-card deployment exposed the already characterized tenant
contract again: the legacy managed browser was authenticated at the exact bell
page, and the strict state bridge retained eleven PowerSchool cookies plus the
exact-origin storage record, but `/teachers/home.html` redirected to the
same-origin OIDC authentication endpoint before the bell request. The routine
collector now treats only a recognized authentication redirect from that
auxiliary status request as inconclusive and proceeds to the exact dated bell
request. It still follows no redirect, retains no redirect content, and accepts
the session only if the private bell page passes the exact marker and expected
school-text checks. Synthetic regressions prove a valid bell session succeeds,
an expired session fails at the bell boundary, and a markerless bell page fails
closed. This correction is offline until a rebuilt release and fresh live gate
are separately completed.

The first plan preflight then proved that the cookie-only copy was insufficient:
PowerSchool redirected the fresh browser context to authentication. A bounded
read-only characterization of installed OpenClaw 2026.6.11 found one local
storage entry on the exact active PowerSchool-origin tab. The recovery bridge
therefore now admits only the exact JSON cookie envelope plus one fixed browser
evaluation that returns the document origin and bounded local storage
atomically. Both the returned origin and response URL must equal the configured
PowerSchool origin before the existing ADR-0014 filter runs. It still rejects
session storage, foreign origins, profiles, and Google state.

The authorized 2026-08-13 live-preflight continuation then established the
bounded renewal sequence without another login: the legacy app's own
session-HTTP read also returned repair-required, while its existing persistent
browser performed a passive three-period read and silently renewed the session.
The strict bridge immediately re-exported eleven PowerSchool cookies and one
exact-origin storage record. The fresh canary plan preflight then succeeded and
stored a verified three-meeting plan. The isolated active-Classroom preflight
also succeeded. The `Auto Lesson 2` read-only Calendar preflight observed zero
events, proposed exactly three create intents, and attempted and completed zero
mutations.

A ten-minute provider-inaccessible loopback reader then supplied only normalized
candidate semantics and stopped cleanly. The initial evidence builder used only
the legacy section-code field and correctly reported three label differences;
the established UI semantic is the legacy course-name-plus-section-code
composite, which exactly matches Chalkwright's normalized label. The corrected
ID-free comparison matched all three dates, intervals, summaries, readiness,
display state, ownership qualification, and plan verification with zero
differences. The immutable evidence fingerprint is
`sha256:77071f2349eaf2a95ba25bdf1ee7236caa1251210cfdb666de01a49a70ba69af`.
The comparison's candidate Calendar semantics are the three planned
reconciliation intents derived from the verified plan; they are not a claim
that those events already exist in Google Calendar. The separate read-only
provider preflight observed zero existing events in `Auto Lesson 2` and made
zero mutations.
This is preactivation evidence only; no candidate service, timer, route, Calendar
mutation, Fully Kiosk change, M-17 activation, or promotion followed.

The first protected activation manifest was subsequently bound with fingerprint
`sha256:2fda6668afbd28b2b3ee843e5ed42438cab30dacfdb496eb4c37e8ab74e925b2`.
Independent review then found that its seven-day observation window began before
candidate activation. That manifest is therefore rejected for activation and
must be superseded through the protected, recoverable bind procedure immediately
before a separately authorized activation. No service, timer, route, provider
mutation, or kiosk change occurred under it, and its inactive elapsed time does
not count as canary coverage. Supersession and activation are serialized
operator actions; no activation, manifest operation, or candidate-route command
may run concurrently with the bounded precondition checks and atomic archive.

That rejected manifest was archived successfully with zero provider, service,
or route changes, and a fresh exact seven-day manifest was bound with
fingerprint
`sha256:e84fdcc9a9ba7155d5b6382a3f191eae4f3f94f490228af418db52280e332a65`.
The first activation attempt then passed manifest, plan, Classroom, integrity,
backup, server-health, and readiness gates but failed closed before Calendar
mutation with `calendar-write-input-invalid`. Rollback stopped the candidate
server and left all five timers and the candidate route inactive; the retained
evidence reported zero attempted and completed external mutations. Offline
diagnosis found that real deterministic Calendar intent IDs compose the plan,
scope, and meeting identities and can safely exceed the writer and SQLite
journal's generic 128-character bound. The corrected contract permits only
safe IDs of at most 512 characters in approvals, intents, and durable steps;
provider event IDs remain fixed SHA-256-derived values. Forward migration 6
rebuilds only the journal-step table, preserves existing rows, and rejects any
ID beyond the new finite bound. A realistic composed-ID execution regression
and a version-5-to-6 preservation regression now cover the defect.

Those correction gates subsequently completed. The final reviewed archive and
installed release are
`sha256:9986bbad0d320eea5dfe0b5fe705441a1927815f185767a6d24c9781789a8362`.
The failed manifest `sha256:e84fdcc...e332a65` was recoverably archived, the
release advanced only from its recorded predecessor while every candidate unit
was inactive, and new provider-inaccessible comparison evidence bound manifest
`sha256:3ef42b8d902a61b9add8afd6f15812f2076810050f9d275371d165922b2230bb`.
An initial retry reached the verifier moments before the bound start and failed
with zero effects; a fixed value-free diagnostic then verified every binding
after the window opened.

The authorized activation at 2026-08-13 12:23 Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh passed plan,
Classroom, SQLite integrity, verified backup, server health/readiness, and
manifest gates. It created exactly three owned events in `Auto Lesson 2`,
started all five isolated timers, and retained report-only alerts. The immediate
second Calendar reconciliation observed three events and attempted/completed
zero mutations. The separately retained private Tailnet candidate route proxies
only to loopback port 4319 and returns healthy/ready responses; its hostname is
intentionally excluded from public source. The legacy 9443 route inventory
remained unchanged. After the reviewed presentation fixes were
installed and rebound, the active observation window reset to exactly
2026-08-13 12:50 through 2026-08-20 12:50 Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh.
That active manifest has fingerprint
`sha256:69ccff3c358f0edd3cbd7a09f9e4d3ec8ccfac20eb2fe12a56f052903da99f7f`;
it is approved only for recoverable supersession before the reviewed
future-preview correction and must not be reused afterward.

The first physical end-of-day observation correctly selected `day_complete`
but exposed the previously deferred next-class-day acquisition gap: only the
current date had been imported, so the next-plan query had no future snapshot.
The offline correction extends the same read-only PowerSchool refresh with a
hard seven-date lookahead. It stores provider-verified empty days, excludes
them from class-day selection, skips dates that yield no usable exact schedule
without storing or trusting that absence, and stores every verified plan in the
bounded window. An unavailable current date no longer prevents the lookahead,
so a Sunday run queries and retains the complete following Monday-through-
Sunday window. Authentication repair and explicit source, transport, scope, or
persistence failures still stop immediately. Synthetic coverage proves that an
unavailable Sunday and unavailable intervening dates select the later verified
class day without persisting either unavailable date. At that checkpoint, live
qualification still required a reviewed release and a physical `day_complete`
result.

That correction was subsequently installed as release
`sha256:a1061444548f4f47d0d632e83425f1e5df24cd34e27631ecfa4ed751b52b5fdf`
and rebound under manifest
`sha256:41cc8a7ea7e73ba514862bdf72faaaa287ec19f28e6f603a4ae7dfbc475435d9`.
After one fresh passive navigation renewed the existing legacy browser session,
the strict filtered-state bridge and candidate activation succeeded without a
new login. Local health and readiness were clean, the rendered state contained
`day_complete`, Friday, August 14, and the next real class-day schedule, and
the user accepted the physical Fully Kiosk result. This closes the physical
end-of-day-preview defect; the broader observation and final-handoff gates
remain open.

The subsequent recovery advanced the inactive installation to release
`sha256:38e597fd3486e676549dde2e802a98a0edc56739c868ee9349ab8f4ad88be04a`,
which became the predecessor for the later native-authentication upgrade. It
contains the centered bell cluster, restored
legacy objective-card pointer, Classroom checkmark and due-date badge, plus the
narrow authenticated-bell fallback. The current-day read then succeeded, but
the transaction stopped when the future-preview lookahead treated Saturday's
unavailable schedule as fatal; cleanup left the candidate stopped, its Tailnet
route absent, and no new activation manifest.
The prior live manifest had been value-free fingerprinted as
`sha256:c3b9540d6e30ef6a4e8d5e73b6ccd69a80c59f251f1d4d74ad7e9cafbace53da`
and was archived through the fixed recoverable supersession helper before that
attempt. The pending runtime delta skips an unavailable future date without
storing or trusting it and continues within the existing seven-date bound; it
does not change presentation, domain, or provider authority.

[ADR-0022](../decisions/0022-parallel-production-canary.md) replaces M-17's
immediate handoff sequence with a parallel-canary activation gate followed by a
separately approved final-handoff gate. It does not renumber, split, promote,
or begin a later milestone.

## Accepted topology

| Boundary  | Legacy authority                         | Classroom Hub canary                                                                     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display   | Existing private `/classroom-screen` URL | Separate exact Tailnet-only URL and loopback candidate port                              |
| Calendar  | Existing Calendar                        | Manually created secondary owned Calendar; exact target plus primary/legacy deny binding |
| State     | Existing legacy state                    | Separate SQLite, backup, lease, journal, marker, and configuration roots                 |
| Processes | Existing OpenClaw jobs/services          | Distinct repository-owned service and timer names                                        |
| Refresh   | Existing cadence                         | Bounded read-only provider acquisition at an approved staggered cadence                  |
| Alerts    | Existing alert behavior                  | Report-only; the direct Telegram adapter remains unwired                                 |
| TV        | Existing URL remains normal              | Bounded reversible Fully Kiosk evaluation windows only                                   |

The Google account may be the same because the Calendar targets are disjoint.
The credential is still broader than one calendar, so the application contract
must enforce the exact candidate target and deny the primary and legacy
targets. The application will not request authority to create or administer
calendars.

## Offline implementation evidence

The review lane now contains:

1. a value-free canary manifest fixing port `4319`, distinct configuration,
   state and release roots, `Auto Lesson 2`, report-only alerts, staggered
   `07:25` plan and `07:28` Calendar cadence, and candidate-only stop order;
2. sixteen inert `.in` service/timer artifacts with no `[Install]` section,
   including a mechanically read-only Calendar preflight separate from sync
   and provider-inaccessible integrity/verified-backup jobs;
3. an exact protected provisioner deriving the secondary Calendar identity and
   legacy deny hash from the already-qualified M-14 reference without printing
   either value;
4. a validator that rejects `primary`, the legacy Calendar, target/deny
   overlap, extra fields, unsafe references, and non-canary state;
5. an exact one-day Calendar reconciler using existing ownership audit,
   projection, durable lease, journal, idempotency, etag, and
   `sendUpdates=none` contracts;
6. a provider-free copier that transfers only validated filtered PowerSchool
   state into the distinct canary directory and never copies a browser profile;
7. digest-bound release build, inert install, exact activation, and a
   candidate-only stop script that quiesces every timer and in-flight oneshot;
8. a provider-neutral semantic comparator whose input cannot represent provider
   IDs and whose retained evidence binds date, time, summary, ownership,
   readiness, display state, and plan verification; and
9. a protected immutable activation-manifest binder/verifier that binds the
   release, Calendar/deny hashes, proposed Tailnet target, legacy-route
   fingerprint, exact stop command, comparison evidence, and observation
   window before activation. Synthetic tests cover target isolation,
   convergence, malformed evidence, protected config, state filtering,
   systemd drift, and provisioning drift.

The static repository manifest deliberately leaves the exact Tailnet target,
legacy-route deny fingerprint, release, comparison, and observation window as
live bindings. Before activation, explicit preactivation mode exports one
create-once protected comparison record so the activation manifest
must bind all of them and pass the compiled verifier. Continued normalized
legacy-versus-candidate comparison evidence is then collected repeatedly in
SQLite during the observation interval without recreating or replacing the
immutable preactivation export.
The separate provider-inaccessible observation service supplies that repeatable
contained invocation; it cannot recreate the preactivation export.

The final offline gate passed documentation, fixture and repository safety,
operational verification, formatting, strict server/client types, all 742
tests, production build, startup smoke, six-job rehearsal, M-16 cutover
rehearsal, dependency audit, publication safety, and `git diff --check` with
zero provider, service, route, or kiosk effects. A separate primary-agent
security review also tightened the systemd verifier to reject broadened or
duplicate hardening assignments and found no remaining material issue. The
separately authorized independent review then verified the complete source and
final archive against baseline `0cb49d6e765673a960692879af55dc96bd24ba35`
and issued a clean disposition for the live-preflight/proposal gate. It did not
approve activation, routing, provider activity, kiosk changes, promotion, or
final handoff.

The later legacy-bell, minute-only clock, and objective-card visual parity
corrections, including the narrow authenticated-bell fallback for an auxiliary
teacher-home authentication redirect, passed the same complete offline gate.
The subsequent decoupled parity slice and current resource-policy correction
passed 794/794 tests after adding
provider-free static lesson and bilingual vocabulary projection, independent
attendance configuration, future-plan contract checks, bounded future-class-day
preactivation comparison, and retiring the executable legacy state bridge. Chrome
150 rendered the synthetic in-class scene at
3840x2160, 1920x1080, 1366x768, 768x1024, and 390x844 without overflow or
console/page errors; the 1920x1080 inspection showed the visible upper-right
date before the minute-only clock and the bell badge vertically centered with
that clock. The badge displayed `60`, labelled `60 minutes until bell`, in a
101.5x48-pixel bounded region. Its bell and minute count form one centered
cluster with at most a four-pixel gap, and the digits are centered within their
bounded slot; the redundant lower-left `Dismissal begins` countdown is absent.
Non-class states hide the badge, reduced-motion mode suppresses the shimmer,
and repeated unchanged target polls update the countdown without replacing the
scene DOM. The inert candidate archive is
`/tmp/chalkwright-m17-canary-runtime.tar.gz`; its exact digest and size are
reported only after the builder enforces owner-only mode `0600`, then recorded
outside the archive after packaging. It has not been installed or activated.

The subsequent objective-card visual parity correction preserves structured
Classroom content through the display projection and restores the legacy
pointer, Classroom checkmark, and month/day due-date badge. The icons are
decorative (`aria-hidden`) and the full instruction and due-date strings remain
in the accessible list. Synthetic markup and controller regressions bind the
structure, while the bounded Chrome viewport suite verifies the two icons and
calendar badge have nonzero geometry without changing provider, domain, or
operator authority. That correction and the authenticated-bell fallback are
installed inertly in release
`sha256:38e597fd3486e676549dde2e802a98a0edc56739c868ee9349ab8f4ad88be04a`,
but activation stopped at the later future-plan preflight and never restored
the candidate route. The subsequent unavailable-future-date correction is
offline-qualified in the superseding archive and remains uninstalled.

Release
`sha256:0fd5b3f0c638e988ad152faf7b324b15a88a8675befaffafffee9e7edfb322ab`
was installed inertly and the native repair again reached the exact dated bell
marker, but the immediately following credential-free plan preflight still
returned `production-powerschool-bell-session-redirect-authentication`.
Therefore the earlier installed-Chrome user-agent correction was necessary but
not sufficient for this tenant: PowerSchool accepted the browser request and
rejected replay of the same filtered cookies through Node's HTTP stack. The
new offline correction adds one application-owned browser-native fallback only
after that exact bell authentication redirect. It permits one exact document
GET in the disposable filtered-state context and blocks every redirect,
identity request, and subresource at Chrome's protocol boundary. A synthetic
tenant that rejects non-navigation bell requests proves the fallback succeeds
without identity traffic or credentials, while expired and unconditionally
rejected sessions remain repair-required. This correction remains uninstalled
and does not qualify the live handoff; one new native repair followed by one
exact routine plan preflight is still required.

Release
`sha256:bfc0e179a0ff59dea8d13e439d2f78fc13edc65e0ef1a1a3e89e15fe5747626c`
was then installed inertly. Native repair succeeded, but the credential-free
browser-native bell retry still received the same recognized authentication
redirect. The next offline correction preserves an exact PowerSchool CHIPS
cookie partition that the prior `storageState()` projection omitted. It reads
the complete cookie records through locked Playwright's cookie API, retains
only the exact PowerSchool origin or Chrome's immediate schemeful parent-site
partition including Chromium's `hasCrossSiteAncestor` component, rejects
foreign, broader, or incomplete partitions, and restores cookies without
broadening them. The bounded Node lane neither emits retained partitioned
cookies in a raw header nor accepts a `Partitioned` response cookie because it
cannot reconstruct the full browser partition key from that header alone.
Exact-pinned `tldts` 7.4.9 derives the registrable domain from the Public Suffix
List instead of deleting a guessed number of DNS labels. Installed-Chrome
coverage proves both ancestor values round-trip exactly. Release
`sha256:7d74018761419c62967d9f03f8c0dd1dfc6582460444bdfacbe560f0e5b1ee4a`
installed that correction. Native repair succeeded, but the disposable-profile
plan read still received the exact authentication redirect.

The next offline correction composes the already accepted Chalkwright-owned
retained-profile collector into an exact credential-free plan entrypoint. Only
the repair and plan units can access that profile; plan units cannot access the
protected repair references or 1Password service-account file. The reader may
perform bounded silent OIDC through the exact configured origins, but it has no
credential, form-fill, repair, or operator-controlled navigation capability.
No OpenClaw process, API, MCP tool, profile, or state is read. Release
`sha256:63aee9291f56c0e5cf012f8c643ac01feb1f2464739ce1ccb599bafa01790fd4`
installed this correction inertly. Its first live qualification exposed two
startup defects before provider access: the repair wrapper's direct-entrypoint
check did not recognize the installed `current` symlink and therefore exited
without running, while the retained-plan unit did not supply the fixed Google
identity origin required by its silent-renewal policy. The next correction
uses the repository's symlink-safe invocation helper and binds that exact
non-secret identity origin in both repair and plan units. The native handoff
remains unqualified pending one real native repair followed by one exact live
retained-session plan preflight. The complete gate also proves that
the production parent permits the supervisor's full two-second graceful plus
one-second forced-quiescence cleanup window before hard stop, while installed
Chrome rejects POST, WebSocket, popup, download, response-size, and top-level
request-budget drift.

The separately authorized one-time protected migration copied the quiescent
legacy PowerSchool Chrome profile into Chalkwright's dedicated retained-profile
root without creating any continuing OpenClaw or legacy-path dependency. The
credential-free qualification then failed closed with the sanitized
`request-policy-violation` code. The original protected snapshot remains
retained. This release adds only a fixed, value-free first-violation reason so
the next contained diagnostic can distinguish an origin, method, popup,
WebSocket, size, budget, or browser-control failure without printing URLs,
headers, page content, schedule content, or authentication state.
The value-free reason identified a blocked resource origin. Release
`sha256:a98e8170c792110b19935da0d9819302d7ddc645f47627839f2a52fd7c213421`
restored the predecessor collector's exact three Google static-resource
origins as compiled defaults, but its diagnostic remained blocked because the
older protected plan environment supplied an explicit list that suppressed
those defaults. The next correction enforces the same reviewed baseline even
when an explicit list is present. Such a list must retain the exact
PowerSchool and identity origins and may add only individually validated exact
origins; it cannot remove or wildcard the fixed baseline.
Release
`sha256:08df6ddb92c5419d0bb4b942247d6337faacfdd7ae68b22277737035e3d2aa47`
installed that correction inertly, and its diagnostic proved that a genuinely
additional resource origin remains blocked. The next diagnostic narrows that
origin only to a fixed family without retaining or printing its URL and does
not authorize the blocked request.
Release
`sha256:1099c2edbc2e7b3ba6c57e9d523cbb50131d1544af39d20fb58591580ecedd95`
installed that classifier inertly. Its diagnostic narrowed the request to the
PowerSchool registrable site but did not establish whether it was the exact
parent, a child of the configured host, or a sibling. The next value-free
classifier distinguishes those three cases while continuing to block all of
them; no new authenticated destination is authorized by that evidence.
Release
`sha256:98222019a092c81532f33b944c35beffd7758fe2a380b8d0959467d7c1d289f5`
installed that refinement inertly. Its diagnostic identified a sibling in the
PowerSchool registrable site. The next diagnostic reduces a single-label
sibling only to a fixed common role or `other`, retains no hostname, and still
blocks the request.
Release
`sha256:16b03199deb3f5196c0871226a96f830a0802e3b308ebed8a40abf4eca98309a`
installed that classifier inertly and returned the fixed `other` role. The
operator then explicitly authorized a one-time terminal-only exact
blocked-origin diagnostic. The temporary diagnostic release emits only one
strict DNS sibling label in its bounded code, still blocks the request, and
must be replaced after the exact destination decision. That diagnostic
identified the single label `assets-sis`; the operator then approved only the
derived exact HTTPS origin beneath the configured PowerSchool registrable site.
The superseding offline release adds that one origin to the fixed resource
baseline for GET/HEAD requests and removes the label-bearing diagnostic output.
No wildcard, sibling family, or additional method is authorized.
That release's contained diagnostic then identified the distinct fixed sibling
role `assets`. The operator separately approved only its derived exact HTTPS
origin. The next offline release adds that origin under the same GET/HEAD-only
resource policy; every other sibling remains blocked.
That release's contained run reached a nested same-site sibling. Rather than
disclose any additional hostname text, the next offline classifier reports
only whether it is a child of the already approved `assets-sis` origin, a child
of the already approved `assets` origin, or another nested sibling. It still
blocks the request and adds no origin authority.
The following live attempt confirmed that per-host discovery would repeat for
ordinary PowerSchool same-site resources. The superseding offline release
therefore removes the temporary label diagnostic and permits HTTPS PowerSchool
same-site origins only as subresources. To copy the proven legacy browser
capture behavior without coupling to OpenClaw, those subresources may use
GET/HEAD plus browser-internal OPTIONS/POST methods; exact PowerSchool
top-level reads remain GET/HEAD-only. Top-level sibling navigation, non-HTTPS
origins, unrelated registrable sites, form methods, downloads, popups,
WebSockets, and non-resource authority remain blocked.

## Historical remaining live gates

Before the completed operational handoff, initial provisioning, filtered-state
recovery, provider preflights, semantic comparison, earlier activation, first
reconciliation/readback, and the separate Tailnet route were completed. At
that historical checkpoint, the candidate was stopped, its route was absent,
and the superseding future-preview release remained inert. The remaining gates
at that time were:

- physical Fully Kiosk evaluation during bounded windows, with the legacy URL
  retained as the immediate fallback;
- repeated provider-inaccessible semantic comparison and active-school-day
  behavior through the bound interval;
- observed scheduled refresh, Calendar convergence, backup/integrity, restart,
  and recovery behavior;
- user acceptance of the canary and a final `Auto Lesson 2` disposition; and
- a separately approved final route/scheduler/writer/alert handoff.

ADR-0024 now records the requested removal of the final steady-state OpenClaw
dependency. The offline candidate adds a separate, no-timer native PowerSchool
repair service over the already qualified JIT worker and persistent
compatibility profile. Its protected additive provisioner targets only fixed
Chalkwright-owned paths. Routine plan jobs retain no repair or 1Password
authority; the current offline entrypoint uses only the dedicated retained
profile for browser-bound silent renewal. The separately authorized live gate provisioned the protected
references and installed the isolated service. An earlier native repair plus
credential-free job acquired the current and a future plan before the
independently known future-plan persistence failure, but the latest repeat
exposed the request-identity handoff defect described above. The corrected
handoff is superseded by the retained-profile entrypoint and still requires a
fresh live native repair and exact plan read. A later value-free diagnostic
verified the replacement service-account token, exact vault, single Login
item, and all three fixed references; the installed repair nevertheless
failed before browser launch because service-account `op read` had no private
writable CLI configuration directory. The offline correction now supplies one
fresh cache-disabled directory only to those fixed reads, removes it on every
path, and fails closed while scrubbing acquired buffers if cleanup cannot be
proven. The legacy bridge remains retired from the active recovery procedure.

This was the pre-handoff status. The current status is the completed handoff
recorded at the top of this document.

## Historical bounded readiness sequence

After the full offline gate passes, the shortest reversible sequence is:

1. authorize protected provisioning;
2. build the runtime archive, record its SHA-256, approve that exact digest,
   and install the release plus inert units;
3. invoke the application-owned, operator-only native PowerSchool repair
   service if the retained Chalkwright session needs repair; do not read or
   copy any legacy application state;
4. initialize the isolated canary SQLite database once through the
   release-bound, privilege-dropped, provider-free initializer;
5. authorize one read-only plan/Classroom preflight and one read-only semantic
   Calendar preflight against `Auto Lesson 2`; construct and retain the exact
   ID-free semantic comparison evidence;
6. inventory the proposed Tailnet target and legacy route without changing
   either, choose the bounded observation window, and bind the protected
   activation manifest to those values, the reviewed release, Calendar deny
   hashes, comparison evidence, and packaged stop command;
7. authorize candidate activation; require local integrity and a verified
   backup before readiness and the bounded Calendar reconciliation;
8. bind the approved candidate-only Tailnet URL to loopback port `4319` while
   recording a deny fingerprint for the legacy route; and
9. verify health/readiness/display/Calendar results before a temporary Fully
   Kiosk window. On any failure, run the candidate-only stop sequence; do not
   touch the legacy application.
