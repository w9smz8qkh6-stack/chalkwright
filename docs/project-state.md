# Current Chalkwright project state

This is the canonical, compact semantic state of the repository. Edit
`docs/project-knowledge.json`, review it against implementation and operating
evidence, record the new implementation fingerprint, and run `npm run
docs:sync`. Repository documentation is not a live-service probe.

## Freshness contract

- Reviewed: `2026-08-31` (0 days ago; maximum 7)
- Implementation files covered: 559
- Implementation fingerprint: `71bbd0ef06b7b35111a50af791d803b6da5285e2c64d65e227b857a1fe285e13`
- Semantic review: **CURRENT**
- Review statement: The phase, capabilities, workstreams, limits, repository-backed deployment claim, M-18 retirement record, completed A01-A08 architecture work, C01 configuration services, and C02 operator shell were reviewed together against the A02 threat model, accepted ADR-0026, the A07 information architecture, the exact A08 fixture suite, focused C01/C02 tests, browser evidence, and governing documentation in this worktree. C02 composes C01 reads into guarded A07 feature-region models behind a distinct explicit-loopback Node listener with its own closed operator route table, server-rendered seven-page document/navigation shell, finite capability/readiness discovery, restrictive response headers, persistent reachability warning, and bounded error page. Host, Origin, forwarding, method, content-type, canonical request-target, and route negatives fail closed; authority-form and normalized path aliases are rejected before lookup, and architecture and integration tests prove display ingress cannot resolve an operator handler. The real adapter passes the exact A08 C02 result with no account or JavaScript requirement, and browser evidence covers the accepted viewports, 200% effective reflow, reduced motion, no-JavaScript navigation, landmarks, focus, targets, overflow, and page/console errors. The executable composition requires explicit synthetic acknowledgement and uses the bounded in-memory C01 adapter; it is not an installed or durable production service. C02 adds no mutation workflow, rooms/screens/class-code implementation, source acquisition/forms, planned-display projection, provider integration, account/session/authentication, billing, commercial framework decision, package hardening, deployment, or live effect. C03 is next; Phase B and D00 remain gated behind C10. Landing-page and synthetic-display worktrees remain separately owned, and no live application, provider, credential, route, or classroom-display probe was performed.
- Working-tree classification is evaluated live by hooks and documentation gates; volatile change counts are intentionally excluded from this tracked view.

## Development position

- Phase: **Production stabilization and public-preview preparation**
- Milestone: **M-18 completed; legacy app and migration shadow retired to cold recovery**
- Release: `0.1.0`
- Summary: The standalone Chalkwright service is documented as the classroom display source of truth. The legacy app and migration shadow are retired from active service with cold-recovery artifacts retained. Current repository work continues on post-retirement stabilization, roadmap design, demonstration reproducibility, synthetic fixture presentation, and the self-documenting development workflow.

## Documented deployment state

- Status: `documented-production`
- Summary: Repository evidence says the standalone production lane serves the existing classroom display path, provider acquisition and owned-Calendar follower jobs are active, and M-18 retired the legacy app and migration shadow from active service while retaining cold-recovery artifacts.
- Evidence basis: Reviewed repository documentation through origin/main commit 0f8f65f, including the completed M-18 record. This semantic refresh performed no new application-service, provider, credential, route, or classroom-display probe.
- Evidence: [`README.md`](../README.md), [`docs/permanent-production-deployment.md`](permanent-production-deployment.md), [`docs/migration/m17-review-package.md`](migration/m17-review-package.md), [`docs/migration/m18-retirement-record.md`](migration/m18-retirement-record.md)

## Current priorities

- Observe post-retirement production stability and preserve the retained cold-recovery evidence and explicit restoration boundary.
- Make the repository's present state, capabilities, workstreams, limitations, and verification status continuously available to Codex.
- Continue with C03 against the completed private C02 operator shell; keep C04, C09, and C10 in the authoritative operator-first sequence.
- Keep privacy-safe demonstration work reproducible, accessible, independently versioned, and operationally separate from application releases.
- Continue bounded enrichment work for learning objectives, lesson references, vocabulary, and setup usability without broadening provider authority.

## Capability registry

Statuses are deliberately explicit: `documented-production` is a reviewed
repository claim, not a fresh service probe; `implemented` may still require
separate activation authority; `fixture-supported`, `planned`, and
`deferred` describe narrower maturity.

## Active workstreams

### Obsessively self-documenting development workflow

- Status: `active`
- Outcome: Keep semantic project state and capability knowledge current, enforced, and directly available inside every Codex task.
- Present state: The generated documentation router, tiered session and prompt hooks, quiet resume/compaction host refresh, path watcher, timer, semantic state registry, implementation-fingerprint gate, workstream classification, and isolated-worktree guidance are implemented in this branch and installed on the canonical host.
- Capabilities: `deployment-and-rollback`, `fixture-evaluation`
- Next: Maintain the registry and relevant durable prose with every implementation change, acknowledge each new implementation fingerprint only after semantic review, and keep the complete verification chain green.
- Documentation: [`docs/documentation-system.md`](documentation-system.md), [`docs/project-state.md`](project-state.md)

### Privacy-safe homepage demonstration

- Status: `active`
- Outcome: Produce reproducible, accessible, privacy-safe media that explains Chalkwright accurately on the separate public landing page.
- Present state: Synthetic storyboards, narration/render tooling, provenance boundaries, and landing-page operating instructions remain an active application-repository workstream. The published 123-second native-1080p cut follows one coherent day: Web Design appears in the first coming-up state and completes its class sequence before the later Robotics sequence and Robotics dismissal. Its Web Design opening uses a measured natural clause pause; the Classroom-to-vocabulary handoff uses a short continuous breath without a fade. Every captured display state uses the ChalkWright logo as the unconfigured school-brand placeholder. The Robotics sequence animates its explicitly labeled Google Classroom assignment, task details, and due date before its translation faces; the assignment remains stable through the edit instead of beginning an automatic card advance during its final frames. The translation faces remain synchronized to narration-topic boundaries without repeating the language enumeration. Displayed demo branding uses ChalkWright casing, the schedule narration says the day's complete schedule, and the closing voice explicitly says Apache two point oh. This corrected cut is live at chalkwright.org with accurate default-on captions and a dedicated visible CC toggle. A newer unpublished 123-second candidate removes the unspoken fourth overview bullet, retimes each anatomy callout to lead its matching spoken phrase by about 0.2 seconds, lets the final full-screen pullback settle after narration, introduces the second class with the authentic Robotics coming-up display before dissolving during the spoken pause into its objective, and shortens the following narration to avoid repeating the Robotics class name. The landing page's separate private repository uses main as the default branch and records the deployed source at commit 7a4a9f207ff46c21092f8f7aef855c018e8095d8. The Lenovo origin and public Cloudflare route were verified on 2026-08-30, including exact video and caption hashes, text/vtt caption delivery, HTTP 206 video ranges and a zero-finding production dependency audit. Authorized capacity recovery and publication cleanup removed superseded build cache and predecessor images; the current live image and canonical source remain intact, with no predecessor image retained. Future landing-page changes require their canonical application documentation and semantic-state handoff within the same task.
- Capabilities: `classroom-display`, `lesson-enrichment`, `site-presentation`, `fixture-evaluation`
- Next: Maintain reproducible media provenance, caption accuracy, public delivery checks and independent landing-page source history as the demonstration evolves.
- Documentation: [`docs/project-state.md`](project-state.md), [`docs/future-parity-roadmap.md`](future-parity-roadmap.md)

### Synthetic display-content polish

- Status: `active`
- Outcome: Keep fixture-backed captures representative of current objectives, assignments, and multilingual vocabulary without introducing private classroom data.
- Present state: The B407 synthetic fixture and preview evidence include richer Web Design and Robotics carousel content. Coursework retains an explicit Google Classroom presentation, the Robotics assignment includes synthetic task and due-date details, and an unconfigured school-brand slot uses the ChalkWright placeholder logo; corresponding display assertions are updated.
- Capabilities: `classroom-display`, `lesson-enrichment`, `fixture-evaluation`
- Next: Verify the accepted viewport envelope and regenerate only reproducible synthetic preview evidence when presentation behavior changes.
- Documentation: [`docs/b407-display-mvp.md`](b407-display-mvp.md), [`docs/project-state.md`](project-state.md)

### Core configuration panel and hosted-shell planning

- Status: `active`
- Outcome: Move the agreed Core operator panel and related hosted-shell direction through an architecture-ready, measurable implementation gate without changing live runtime behavior prematurely.
- Present state: A01 through A08, C01, and C02 are complete in this worktree. C01 provides the versioned configuration service and bounded in-memory conformance adapter. C02 composes its reads into guarded A07 regions behind a distinct explicit-loopback Node process with a closed operator-only route table, server-rendered seven-page shell/navigation, capability and readiness discovery, restrictive response headers, persistent private-reachability warning, and finite error boundary. The exact A08 C02 scenario passes without an account or JavaScript requirement. Host, Origin, forwarding, method, content-type, canonical request-target, route, display-ingress, responsive viewport, 200% reflow, reduced-motion, no-JavaScript, keyboard/focus, overflow, and browser-error evidence passes. Authority-form, dot-segment, encoded dot-segment, and backslash-normalized targets are rejected before route lookup. The executable is explicitly synthetic/in-memory and no parser, fetcher, OAuth client, mutation workflow, durable persistence schema/adapter, installed production service, provider enrollment, account flow, hosted repository, billing integration, commercial framework selection, package hardening, deployment, or live effect changed.
- Capabilities: `guided-setup`, `preview-and-controls`, `durable-state`, `fixture-evaluation`
- Next: Execute C03 through the completed private C02 shell by adding room, screen, timezone, display-reference, and class-code lifecycle controls. Continue the operator-first lane through C04, C09, and C10; do not begin Phase B or D00 before C10 is accepted.
- Documentation: [`docs/core-and-hosted-feature-acceptance-matrix.md`](core-and-hosted-feature-acceptance-matrix.md), [`docs/core-and-hosted-threat-model.md`](core-and-hosted-threat-model.md), [`docs/core-workspace-actor-contracts.md`](core-workspace-actor-contracts.md), [`docs/core-configuration-state-contracts.md`](core-configuration-state-contracts.md), [`docs/core-source-mode-contracts.md`](core-source-mode-contracts.md), [`docs/core-operator-panel-information-architecture.md`](core-operator-panel-information-architecture.md), [`docs/core-operator-shell.md`](core-operator-shell.md), [`docs/core-goal1-fixture-contract-suite.md`](core-goal1-fixture-contract-suite.md), [`docs/core-and-hosted-implementation-work-breakdown.md`](core-and-hosted-implementation-work-breakdown.md), [`docs/project-state.md`](project-state.md)

## Known limits

- General installation support and public-production readiness for external adopters are not claimed.
- M-18 removed the active legacy and shadow fallbacks; any temporary cold-recovery restoration now requires explicit incident authorization and must be disabled again after the bounded recovery window.
- PowerSchool and Google Classroom remain read-only; Calendar writes remain limited to verified application-owned events.
- Semantic documentation accuracy is a mandatory model-reviewed completion condition; documented deployment claims still require a separately authorized live probe before being reported as current live state.
- The current strict runtime configuration is not yet the intended guided end-user setup experience. C01 implements reusable configuration lifecycle use cases and an in-memory conformance adapter. C02 invokes C01 reads through an explicit-loopback, synthetic-only operator process and server-rendered shell, but adds no mutation workflow, source parser/fetcher, OAuth client, durable persistence adapter, installed service, production route, or live effect; current SQLite schemas and production runtime behavior are unchanged.
- The A06 shared-resource CIDR policy is a reviewed conservative snapshot, not a dynamic future-registry claim. The theoretical 2000::/3 IPv6 envelope is not treated as allocated: only current IANA IPv6 Global Unicast ALLOCATED rows are positive-listed before special-purpose subtraction. Re-review is required before shared-resource implementation and whenever a referenced IANA registry updates.

## Next decisions

- What post-retirement observation interval and evidence should close the remaining stabilization period without weakening the cold-recovery boundary.
- What maintenance and contribution workflow should govern the separate landing page as Chalkwright approaches broader installation support.
- How C03 should add durable room, screen, timezone, display-reference, and slowly hashed class-code lifecycle controls without broadening the C02 private-reachability authority or display ingress.
