# Architecture decision records

Decision records distinguish accepted product/architecture direction from
implementation questions that still require evidence and approval. A proposed
record is not authorization to implement its leading option.

## Status meanings

- **Accepted:** governing direction unless superseded by a later ADR.
- **Proposed:** decision is open; listed options and spike/verification work are
  planning inputs only.
- **Superseded:** retained for history and linked to its replacement.

## Record policy

Each record states context, decision or proposal, alternatives, consequences,
reversibility, and verification implications. Amend an accepted decision with a
new superseding ADR when its trade-off materially changes; do not silently edit
history to make a later implementation appear pre-approved.
