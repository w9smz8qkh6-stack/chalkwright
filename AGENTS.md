# Repository guidance

## Scope

Keep this repository a host-native Node.js/TypeScript application. Preserve the
modular split between configuration, application orchestration, entry points,
and tests. Migration documentation is governed by `docs/README.md` and the
parity inventory. Do not implement migration work or perform migration
operations until the user explicitly requests and authorizes the applicable
scope.

## Security boundaries

- Never commit OAuth tokens or client data, browser profiles, student data,
  runtime state, logs, caches, coverage, compiled output, or generated
  artifacts.
- Treat PowerSchool and Google Classroom as read-only systems. Do not add code,
  scripts, commands, or documentation that writes, updates, deletes, submits,
  acknowledges, or otherwise mutates data in either system.
- Do not inspect or modify live services, scheduled jobs, external data, or
  files outside this repository while working on this project unless the user
  explicitly expands the scope. User authorization may include `sudo` access
  for shell commands required to develop, test, or operate this repository.
- Keep systemd files as repository templates. Never install, enable, start, or
  restart units without explicit authorization.

## Development workflow

- Use `npm ci` for reproducible dependency installation.
- Treat `package-lock.json` as the authoritative dependency graph. Review and
  justify material dependency additions or upgrades; do not add tools merely to
  satisfy a generic checklist.
- Run `npm run check` before handing off changes. It is the offline unified gate
  for documentation, fixture safety, formatting, strict types, tests, production
  build, and startup smoke verification.
- Add tests under `test/` with a path corresponding to the module under `src/`.
- Keep integrations behind typed interfaces and add unit, contract, integration,
  regression, or golden-fixture coverage in proportion to the risk. Fixtures
  must be synthetic or safely redacted.
- Keep environment-specific values out of source control. Document only safe,
  non-secret placeholders in `.env.example`.
- Commit completed, well-scoped work automatically at logical checkpoints with
  meaningful messages. Before committing, verify the staged scope is limited to
  the task, preserves any unrelated user changes, and contains no prohibited
  material. Do not commit known-incomplete or failing work unless the user
  explicitly requests an interim checkpoint.

## Self-documentation and comments

- Follow `docs/engineering-standards.md` and its definition of done.
- Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` with an `Unreleased` section. Record consequential
  user behavior, contracts, migrations, operations, security, dependencies,
  deprecations, and breaking changes; omit trivial formatting and internal
  refactors without behavioral impact.
- Update relevant documentation in the same change as code or contracts. Use
  ADRs and migration records for durable consequential history, and meaningful
  commits as logical review units.
- Prefer clear names, cohesive modules, explicit types, and readable control
  flow over commentary. Comments document intent, invariants, ownership,
  effects, failures, security/privacy, compatibility, and non-obvious reasons;
  never retain dead commented-out code or comments that drift from behavior.
- Document public interfaces and complex domain behavior. Update comments when
  an important invariant or unusual constraint changes.

## Environment and documentation

- Read `.codex/environment.md` when a task depends on the working environment,
  host assumptions, bootstrap commands, external boundaries, or tool versions.
- Use `docs/tooling.md` as the project index of detected and locked tool
  versions and canonical documentation. Prefer version-matched documentation
  and installed local help over model recall when behavior may vary by version.
- Consult the canonical documentation whenever it is helpful, and always before
  relying on version-sensitive behavior, configuration schemas, MCP contracts,
  API contracts, framework behavior, security behavior, or compatibility.
- For OpenAI APIs, MCP, plugins, ChatGPT, or Codex, use the configured
  `openaiDeveloperDocs` MCP server and official OpenAI documentation. Check the
  recorded Codex version and installed `codex --help` when CLI behavior matters.
- Run `npm run docs:check` before handing off documentation, environment, or
  tooling changes; it verifies the generated tooling index, changelog structure,
  and local documentation links.
  Run `npm run docs:sync` after intentional package, runtime, host-tool, Codex,
  MCP, or canonical-link changes, and review the generated diff. When network
  access is authorized, run `npm run docs:check-links` after changing canonical
  links; do not make the normal offline quality gate depend on network access.
